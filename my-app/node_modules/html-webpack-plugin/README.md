  <h1>HTML Webpack Plugin</h1>
  <p>Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles</p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

<h3>Webpack 5</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
```


<h3>Webpack 4</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```


This is a [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your `webpack` bundles. This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply
your own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.

Thanks for supporting the ongoing improvements to the html-webpack-plugin!  

<h2 align="center">Zero Config</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` works without configuration.  
It's a great addition to the [⚙️ webpack-config-plugins](https://github.com/namics/webpack-config-plugins/blob/master/README.md#zero-config-webpack-dev-server-example).

<h2 align="center">Plugins</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration

 * [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security
 * [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage
 * [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin) which generates favicons and icons for iOS, Android and desktop browsers
 * [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used 
 * [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.
 * [html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) for excluding assets using regular expressions
 * [html-webpack-include-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) for including lists of js or css file paths (such as those copied by the copy-webpack-plugin).
 * [html-webpack-injector](https://github.com/thearchitgarg/html-webpack-injector) to inject chunks in `head` or `body` (different locations ) of same html document.
 * [resource-hints-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/resource-hints-webpack-plugin) to add resource hints for faster initial page loads using `<link rel='preload'>` and `<link rel='prefetch'>`
 * [link-media-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yaycmyk/link-media-html-webpack-plugin) allows for injected stylesheet `<link />` tags to have their media attribute set automatically; useful for providing specific desktop/mobile/print etc. stylesheets that the browser will conditionally download
 * [html-webpack-inline-style-plugin](https://github.com/djaax/html-webpack-inline-style-plugin) for inlining styles to HTML elements using [juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice). Useful for email generation automatisation.
 * [html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin) removes empty assets from being added to the html. This fixes some problems with extract-text-plugin with webpack 4.
 * [webpack-concat-plugin](https://github.com/hxlniada/webpack-concat-plugin) for concat and uglify files that needn't to be webpack bundles(for legacy files) and inject to html-webpack-plugin.
 * [html-webpack-link-type-plugin](https://github.com/steadyapp/html-webpack-link-type-plugin) adds a configurable mimetype to resources injected as links (such as adding type="text/css" to external stylesheets) for compatibility with "strict mode".
